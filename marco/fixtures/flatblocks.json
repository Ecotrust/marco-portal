The Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC) shares many of these data needs, and MARCO and NROC are coordinating on the collection and development of data that cover both regions. The data and information identified for MARCO are fundamental to moving forward with regional ocean planning efforts in the Mid-Atlantic, especially in light of state and federal goals for accelerating offshore wind power development along the Atlantic Coast. Federal agencies have both data and expertise that could help meet these needs and many relevant studies are currently underway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe are specifically asking governmental representatives and others in the Mid-Atlantic region:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Do you have spatial data that might address an identified data gap? </li>\r\n    <li>Are you aware of any plans to collect data that might address specific identified data gaps</li>\r\n    <li>Are there additional ocean planning data needs we have not identified?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe welcome your responses to these inquiries, and request that you send information and suggestions to \r\n<a href='mailto:portal@midatlanticocean.org' data-toggle='modal' data-target=\"#feedback-modal\">portal@midatlanticocean.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe data needs list includes attributes for the source of the data, the status of data development, the point of contact for the data, the expected date by which the data will be uploaded to the portal, and already known information about the data. In some cases, the data and information exist or are currently under development, but significant additional effort (e.g. permissions, analysis and formatting) will be required to acquire and prepare the data for use within the regional planning portal. In other cases, the data likely do not currently exist and additional survey and analysis efforts will be needed. As ocean planning moves forward, we expect that additional data needs will be identified (e.g., for socio-economic data) and this list will be updated accordingly.\r\n</p>",
