            "description": "The Mid-Atlantic ports are some of the busiest in the nation\u2019s seaport network, which unloads $3.8 billion in goods each day. ",
            "overview": "<p>\r\nMid-Atlantic maritime industries include shipping, transport, tourism, dredging, offshore sand mining, and some of the nation\u2019s busiest ports at New York-New Jersey, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, and Norfolk. These ports are crucial links in the nation\u2019s transportation system, constitute a key element of the economy, employ many thousands of people, and have the potential to serve as environmental stewards of our region\u2019s harbors and surrounds.\r\n<p>\r\nThe U.S. seaport network unloads $3.8 billion in goods each day and Mid-Atlantic ports are a huge contributor, maintaining several national distinctions. The country\u2019s top port for fruits and juices is Wilmington; the fourth busiest tanker port is Philadelphia; products that go through Baltimore\u2019s ports reach over a third of the country within a day and anything entering the U.S. on wheels--from cars to giant tractors--alight in Baltimore, making it the nation\u2019s top Ro-Ro (roll on-roll off) port. The world\u2019s largest natural deep water harbor is at Hampton Roads and it stays ice-free throughout the year, making it suitable for a conglomeration of military facilities, coal piers, shipyards, and miles of waterfront property and beaches which add to the diversity and stability of our nation. The region supports important points of departure for the nation\u2019s cruise ship industry and, in 2011, close to one million people vacationed on ocean cruises originating in New York and Baltimore.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal contains Automatic Identification System (AIS) information from 2009, processed to focus on highly travelled shipping routes near port entrances. AIS data are collected by the U.S. Coast Guard using automated two-way radio transmissions that track real-time vessel information such as ship identity, purpose, course, and speed, primarily in coastal waters. AIS is required on all passenger vessels and vessels with gross tonnage greater than 300, so smaller vessel traffic is not represented in the database. MARCO is currently consulting with the Coast Guard and shipping industry stakeholders to evaluate how well these data indicate total ship traffic density and what additional data may be needed to fully represent shipping activity.\r\n<p>\r\nThe viability, safety, and growth needs of the commercial shipping industry need to be addressed in regional ocean planning. Accordingly, MARCO will consult with major port and navigation stakeholders to evaluate what additional map data may be needed to inform regional ocean planning decisions and help ensure stakeholder interests are well represented.\r\n",

            "description": "The Mid-Atlantic region is well known for nutrient-rich and highly productive waters. Its estuaries, salt marshes, sea grasses, barrier islands, cold water corals, and submarine canyons provide spawning, nursery, and forage habitats that support diverse resident and migratory marine life including invertebrates, seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals.  ",
            "overview": "<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic is well known for nutrient-rich and highly productive waters. The region is a transitional area between the rocky shores of New England and the gently sloping South Atlantic, and it is influenced by two large estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. As a result, the Mid-Atlantic region  is home to a wealth of complex ecosystems and its estuaries, salt marshes, sea grasses, barrier islands, cold water corals, and submarine canyons provide spawning, nursery, and forage habitats that support diverse resident and migratory marine life including invertebrates, seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. \r\n<p>\r\nThe topography is mostly flat, but features sandy shoals and swales, sand wedges and waves, and a broad continental shelf embedded cold water coral patch habitats and incised by submarine canyons along the shelf-slope break. These areas support biologically diverse and abundant benthic (seafloor) macrofauna, demersal fish, and foraging concentrations of sea birds, sea ducks, and bottlenose dolphins. Benthic habitats contain over 2000 species of invertebrates such as marine worms, sponges, shrimp, crab, clams, scallops, snails, sea stars, and anemones. Another invertebrate--corals--establish reefs that are known to be habitat for black seabass and tautog though research on the locations and extents of these ecologically important patchy habitats is scant.\r\n<p>\r\nDemersal fish (or groundfish) are characterized by their close association with the seafloor for feeding, spawning, and juvenile nursery areas. The Mid-Atlantic region is particularly productive for demersal fish with some such as summer flounder and black seabass supporting major historic and current recreational and commercial fisheries. \r\n<p>\r\nDiadromous fish use both freshwater and marine habitats during their life cycle and these species have great cultural and ecological significance in the Mid-Atlantic region. The diadromous fish of the region\u2014striped bass, alewife, American eel, American Shad, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sturgeon, Atlantic tomcod, blueback herring, hickory shad, rainbow smelt, sea-run brook trout, and shortnose sturgeon--provide an important energy link between freshwater, estuarine, and marine food webs and many of these species are found only in the Northwest Atlantic ocean.\r\n<p>\r\nLarge pelagic fish are migratory are typically found well above the seafloor in the water column. Pelagic species play a key ecological role as predators that regulate their prey communities and structure marine food webs. Some inhabit the region only seasonally and many of the details of their life history are not known. A selection of important species includes albacore tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna, blue marlin, swordfish, great hammerhead shark, sand tiger shark, sandbar shark. The wide ranging distribution of these species across diverse habitat types, their roles as apex predators, and their threatened population status make them ripe for inclusion in regional spatial and conservation plans.\r\n<p>\r\nMarine mammals are large migratory species that use this region primarily in spring and summer when food is abundant. Due to their seasonal abundance and charismatic nature, marine mammals have a long-standing, complex relationship with humans in this region. Ten species, among them bottlenose dolphin, fin whale, harbor porpoise, humpback whale, North Atlantic right whale, and sperm whale are important cultural and biodiversity icons of the region.\r\n<p>\r\nSea turtles use both oceanic (inner shelf region and offshore) and terrestrial (beach) ecosystems. Their highly migratory and long life history characteristics present unique challenges to their continued protection and recovery. Sea turtles may have once comprised an important component of the region\u2019s coastal food webs, consuming prey including fish, invertebrates, and sea grasses. Three species of sea turtle (green, leatherback and loggerhead) are present in the Mid-Atlantic.\r\n<p>\r\nThe varied habitats and abundant resources of the Mid-Atlantic support a highly diverse group of coastal and marine birds that depend on both the oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems of the region throughout the year.  Millions of birds pass through the region, which is located along the globally significant migration corridor of the Atlantic Flyway, while traveling between breeding and wintering grounds that span the entire Western Hemisphere.  Species of high conservation concern, like the Red Knot and Whimbrel depend on high quality coastal habitats for critical stopover areas.  Pelagic species, like the Northern Gannet and Audubon\u2019s Shearwater, use  open water habitats during both migration and wintering seasons.  Shorebirds, waterbirds and waterfowl, such as the Piping Plover, American Oystercatcher, Least Terns, Black Duck and Brant breed or feed along shorelines in the region and can be heavily impacted by increasing human pressure to these coastal systems.  Many of the species occurring in the Mid-Atlantic rank as species of high conservation concern.\r\n<p>\r\nTidal flows, complex seasonal temperature and circulation patterns, and varied seafloor topography combine to create both persistent and shifting habitats that serve as critical resources tracked by Mid-Atlantic marine species, and give rise to upwellings that fuel plankton blooms and key forage species such as menhaden, squid and butterfish.  Millions of seabirds, invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals, and large pelagic fishes such as tunas and marlins use diverse Mid-Atlantic habitat and forage resources in specific ways.  Cross shelf (east-west) migrants like summer flounder and black seabass and north-south migrants like striped bass, menhaden, and large whales all traverse the region twice a year as they move from southern and near shore locations in winter to offshore or northern locations in summer.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal has compiled habitat data, as well as known distributions and abundances of many of the key fish, mammal, bird, and reptile species found in the Mid-Atlantic region. In the future, additional data will be added to round out the collection and to allow regional planners to make management and policy decisions that are compatible with and enhance the conservation of these animals and their ecosystem.",

            "overview": "<p>\r\nRecreation in nature is a basic human need and reflects our values--Americans love to visit, play, and exercise in parks and other public trust lands. Recreation along the coasts and in the ocean is especially valued and, for many, is essential to their well-being and quality of life.  The Mid-Atlantic boasts countless opportunities for entertainment and leisure activities and has flourishing travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation industries, many of which depend on the region\u2019s natural coastal and marine features. Visitors come from all over the country and around the world to enjoy the beaches, wetlands, and barrier islands where they surf, fish, kayak, and participate in organized or self-guided whale and bird watching tours and other pursuits. In addition to the cultural and traditional values coastal and marine ecosystems support, recreational service and supply industries are a significant driver for jobs and the region's economy. For both ethical and economic reasons, developing sound data and information on recreational uses to support forward looking regional ocean planning decisions is critical.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic is a prime location for underwater exploration, and scuba divers can discover a unique array of plants, animals, and historical artifacts. There are countless shipwrecks in the area, for example the 'Faithful Steward'--a British ship headed for Philadelphia in 1785 which lost most of its 250 passengers and was carrying copper coins that can still be found today on Coin Beach, Delaware--and remnants of the Civil War battle between the ironclads Monitor and Merrimac off the coast of Virginia.\r\n<p>\r\nVisitors who prefer to stay on--and not in--the water can experience the natural beauty of the region by sailing, power boating, kayaking, or canoeing. Surfing is also a popular sport with a long history in the region. Various surfing competitions are a big draw for pros and amateurs, as are the occasions when hurricanes bring unusually high waves to Mid-Atlantic shores. And no summary of regional outdoor activities would be complete without mention of the region\u2019s high quality, broad sandy beaches. These beaches are often the jumping off points for diverse active and leisurely pursuits and some of the most popular spots are Virginia Beach, Ocean City, Rehoboth, Cape May, and the beaches of Long Island.\r\n<p>\r\nWhale watching is a well-established ecotourism activity in the Mid-Atlantic. Key attractions are the humpback and right whales that migrate through the region on their long journeys north in the spring to feed in the Gulf of Maine and south to Georgia and northern Florida in the autumn to calve. Thousands of people every year take advantage of the special opportunity to make a connection with the largest animals on the planet and to do so in a non-intrusive way. During these cruises, it is also possible to spot other marine mammals such as dolphins and seals, any of three species of sea turtles including the endangered prehistoric giant that is the leatherback, and bird species that can only be seen at sea. \r\n<p>\r\nThe region's diverse habitats--from extensive coastal marshes and beaches to submarine canyons provide home and stopover sites for hundreds of different bird species and provide plentiful opportunity to see many different nesting and migratory species throughout the year. Many locations along the region\u2019s barrier island coastline including Cape May, Assateague and Chincoteague Islands and the lower eastern shore of Virginia are nationally and globally renowned as premier birding destinations for casual and avid birders alike.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal team is working with partners and stakeholders to develop data and information on recreational uses and places to enhance the ability of coastal and marine planners to account for, protect and increase coastal and marine recreation opportunities in the region.

            "overview": "<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic\u2019s highly productive estuaries and diverse coastal and ocean habitats support substantial commercial and recreational fisheries that provide income, food, and enjoyment for millions of people. Fishing is an essential component of the region\u2019s rich cultural heritage and directly connects coastal community residents and tourists to the ocean, whether through fresh seafood or the thrill of a day spent fishing on the ocean. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2010, the Mid-Atlantic\u2019s commercial harvest was more than 800 million pounds, with Atlantic menhaden making up over 60% of the catch. Other key commercial species include sea scallop, surf clam, ocean quahog clam, summer flounder, lobster, squid, and striped bass. The total 2010 ex-vessel value (initial price paid to fishermen) was well over $500 million and sea scallops were the most valuable of the species. But the value of commercial fisheries extends beyond ex-vessel price. In 2009, the region\u2019s fisheries supported an estimated 116,000 jobs in industries ranging from equipment supply to seafood processing and retail.\r\n\r\nRoughly 2.6 million recreational anglers participated in 17 million saltwater fishing trips in 2009, mainly targeting striped bass, summer flounder, black seabass, tautog, scup, bluefish, drum, weakfish, spot, and croaker. They spent an estimated $3.5 billion on the fishing-related vehicles, tackle, boats, equipment, and second homes. That same year, the recreational fishing industry in the Mid-Atlantic supported approximately 25,000 jobs.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal includes commercial fishing effort for mobile bottom-contacting gear (e.g., trawls and dredges), pelagic gear (e.g., mid-water trawls, gill nets, and hook and line), and all gear combined. The map layers were created using Fishing Vessel Trip Report data provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service. These data are presented at a coarse spatial scale (i.e., 70-100 square nautical miles) and illustrate the regional importance of commercial fishing areas, but are less than ideal for coastal and marine planning. Further, MARCO does not include specific recreational fishing information, although for-hire sector fishing effort is included in the commercial pelagic gear map layer. \r\n<p>\r\nMARCO is working to improve the commercial fishing data represented here and to add recreational fishing information. Planned improvements include creation of higher resolution commercial fishing activity maps and development of products--in conjunction with stakeholders--that best represent commercial fishing interests and values, while protecting confidential information. Efforts to create maps of recreational use areas are being developed with assistance from anglers in all Mid-Atlantic states, and a new online recreational boater survey to enhance these efforts is being designed for implementation in late 2012. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have management authority for most recreational and commercial ocean fisheries. Some migratory species (e.g., sharks and tunas), are managed separately by the National Marine Fisheries Service. MARCO will coordinate and consult with all of these institutions as appropriate to acquire and develop fishing data suitable for public display. ",

            "overview": "<p>\r\nOffshore wind has the potential to be a key domestic renewable energy source, especially for the major cities and large population centers along the East coast of the U.S. The Mid-Atlantic\u2019s offshore wind resources have the potential to produce close to 200 gigawatts of energy every year, enough to power 40 million U.S. homes. Someday, the region\u2019s ocean wave energy could generate an additional 50,000 gigawatts of power and contribute even more significantly to the U.S. energy supply. These renewable energy sources could help meet growing electricity demands in the region and help to reduce carbon emissions. \r\n<p>\r\nProduction of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and ocean waves, may be less damaging to the environment than production through burning of fossil fuels, like oil, natural gas, and coal because renewable energy facilities produce much lower emissions of greenhouse gasses and other harmful pollutants such as arsenic, lead and mercury.  Additionally, renewable energy production may be more cost effective and efficient than traditional methods because once infrastructure is built, the amount of energy produced is quite stable for the remainder of that system\u2019s lifespan. While the inputs (wind and waves) may fluctuate daily or seasonally they should remain consistent over longer time scales, allowing producers and consumers to rely on steady energy levels.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe Department of the Interior has identified Wind Planning Areas (WPA)--locations that may be suitable for wind development--along the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s outer shelf. Data are being collected inside and outside these high priority areas so regulators and stakeholders can make informed and responsible judgments when issuing permits and making siting and investment decisions. Annual average wind speeds are an indication of the potential available energy at a location. Here, wind speeds modeled from limited observations by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and AWS Truepower are expressed at a height of 90 meters above the ocean surface where wind turbine hubs are likely to be located. \r\n<p>\r\nNot all the wind and waves that exist offshore are available for harvest however, and all potential energy estimates should be constrained to account for various environmental and socioeconomic factors that may exist in an area. Some of these constraints include potential overlapping use conflicts with shipping lanes, marine mammal, bird, and bat migration pathways, and traditional areas for fishing and recreational use. Infrastructure may need to be built far enough from shore to address concerns over impacts to scenic views, but close enough that the cost of bringing the electricity to shore is not prohibitive. All of these issues should be accounted for in regional ocean planning and the MARCO Ocean Data Portal provides key information that will help to raise awareness of the potential for renewable energy and support decision maker\u2019s efforts to manage resources effectively and minimize conflicts.\r\n",

Benthic habitats are combinations of EMUs considered with their species assemblages. Thresholds were created by classifying grab samples into organism groups based on similarities in the composition and abundance of the benthic species using hierarchical cluster analysis. To perform this analysis, each grab sample was classified to an organism group, then overlaid on standardized base maps of depth, sediment grain size and seabed forms, and attributed with the information taken from the classified data. Regression trees were built individually for each physical variable to identify critical thresholds that separated sets of organism groups from each other. Regression trees were also built using all variables collectively to identify which variables were driving the organism differences. Each analysis was performed separately by ecological subregion after data exploration revealed that the relationships between genera and physical factors differed markedly among subregions.",

Benthic habitats are combinations of EMUs considered with their species assemblages. Thresholds were created by classifying grab samples into organism groups based on similarities in the composition and abundance of the benthic species using hierarchical cluster analysis. To perform this analysis, each grab sample was classified to an organism group, then overlaid on standardized base maps of depth, sediment grain size and seabed forms, and attributed with the information taken from the classified data. Regression trees were built individually for each physical variable to identify critical thresholds that separated sets of organism groups from each other. Regression trees were also built using all variables collectively to identify which variables were driving the organism differences. Each analysis was performed separately by ecological subregion after data exploration revealed that the relationships between genera and physical factors differed markedly among subregions.",

Wind speed data for all of the MARCO states was created as part of onshore wind mapping projects. Speed data was extrapolated to 50 nautical miles offshore by NREL. The 90 m wind speed was calculated by a linear interpolation between 70 m and 100 m wind speeds. A horizontal discontinuity (seam) in the wind resource is present at the border of New York and New Jersey.

The density grid was created using tracklines that were generated from a 2009 AIS Database using a custom built trackline tool. Vessel tracklines were created separately for each month using the file geodatabases for UTM zones 18 and 19. A unique density grid was created for each combination of month and UTM zone. These grids were then summed together and clipped to the Mid-Atlantic region. To simplify display in on-line data viewers, the summed floating point grid was reclassified into 7 discrete classes using increments of 1/2 standard deviations from the mean density value from 1/2 to 3 standard deviations.",
